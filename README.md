Group project of four people from 2021 that allows a user to edit a videos subtitles and video using microsoft azure api. Pretty cool piece of software. The text to speech sounds a bit odd as uses a computer voice rather than the persons and it doenst quite sync up right. My part was the backend Microsoft Azure API handling code. This project took place over about 8 weeks.
